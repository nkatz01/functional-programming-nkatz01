Write a `C--` interpreter using `Racket` so that it runs as follows:

```
> racket
]=> (load "project1.rkt")           ; your Racket program must be named project1.rkt
]=> (interpret "filename.cmm")      ; filename.cmm is any file that contains a C-- program
```

The invocation of the `racket` interpreter is platform specific; for OSX it is `racket` but 
other platforms may differ.
